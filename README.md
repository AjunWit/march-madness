How can I win my March Madness Pool next year?
This project started after I (again) did not win my March Madness pool. I wanted to understand whether the team’s ranking is an important predictor for the probability that the favorite is able to beat the underdog, and whether there are any other variables that correlate well with the empirical win probabilities.
The files are in the Files branch:
1)	The analysis is the NCAA 2017.xlsx file. It has the results from the NCAA 2017 Men’s tournament in the “data” worksheet
2)	Additional raw data files can be found in NCAA Tournament Teams.xlsx and 2017-Individual-Player-Stats.xlsx
3)	The poster presentation is in the document “How Can I Win My March Madness Pool Next Year.docx”.
